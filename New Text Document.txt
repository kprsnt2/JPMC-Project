You will usually find that an analysis can be done in more than one way. For example, when working with the home mortgage dataset in your task below, how could you chart the answer to the question, “How many mortgage customers are in each borrower age range?” You have at least three options:

Manually filter the data, manually count the number of rows for each filtered borrower age range, then chart those numbers using a new table of those values
Use COUNTIF or SUMIF functions to calculate the number of mortgages that meet each borrower's age range criteria, then chart the numbers in that resulting table
Use a pivot table and pivot chart to automatically group the summary data and plot the chart
Which you choose will depend on how quickly you need the answer, how big your data set is, how often you need to generate an updated answer, and how adept you are at quickly using the advanced tools in Excel.
